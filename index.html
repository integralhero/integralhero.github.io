					<h3>The Short</h3>
					<p>Rally is a web app that allows friends to create and join in on spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment activities like pickup basketball and jam sessions.</p>
					
					<h3>Needfinding </h3>
					<p>
					Our team of four spent a week observing people, specifically close friends doing various activities together (going out, eating, studying, etc). We noticed a common pain point throughout all of these activities: making plans. Whether friends wanted to grab a quick bite to eat or play a quick round of pickup basketball, they were spending massive amounts of time digging through chains of texts to do anything spur-of-the-moment. 
					</p>

					<p>
					We created Rally, a mobile web-application that allows users to create spontaneous activities that their friends could join in on. 
					</p>
					<h3>Prototyping </h3>
					<p>
					
					We built a quick paper prototype using index cards and Sharpie. The paper prototype allowed us to have a conversation with users while allowing us a cheap way to change key application elements without the expensive costs of having to change code. We used the paper prototypes to run through several rounds of heuristic evaluation to find and fix slips and user errors that would occur to miscommunication with the user interface. 
					</p>
					<h3>User Testing </h3>
					<p>
					
					We conducted user tests with an early working prototype with 3 users. We gave them simple directives to perform within the app, like "Create a rally and search for 2 friends to add". Throughout each test, we had users think aloud and tell us what was going through their head as they clicked through each view of the application. 
					</p>
					<h3>What We learned </h3>
					<p>
					There were problems with inconsistent status messages that we caught here, but more importantly we learned a lot more about user expectations. Specifically, we learned that users felt uncomfortable when they found out they could search for anyone using the application; we thought it would be better to limit visibility to local friends.
					</p>
					<p>
					We also ran an A/B test to figure out whether a grid view or list view for recent activities posted would draw more clicks for users to "Rally" with their friends.
					</p>
					<h3>Role/Reflection </h3>
					<p>
					
					I mostly played a full-stack technical role on this project; I designed our database schema and pushed a lot of mission-critical code (searching for friends, creating new Rallies, displaying current Rallies). I learned a lot about working with a team with this project. I also learned a lot about framing with this project: although I believe that our observation that users were spending a lot of time trying to coordinate with one another, I think that I may have jumped too quickly to a mobile-app solution. Additionally, in retrospect, I would have chosen to focus on a more specific group of stakeholders (such as casual basketball players), because I think making our potential audience very broad made our solution too similar to existing platforms. Overall, working on Rally was a great experience that I am super proud of, being that it was the first time I had a chance to work on building something so big from scratch.

<h3>The Short</h3>
<p>The Mobile Innovation Group is a multi-institution research group studying how mobile platforms give rise to innovative new ideas. MIG approached us looking to freshen up their online presence with a new website.</p>

<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>This was built quickly over the course of a weekend from scratch. Jonathan Yan did the mocks for this project and I built it using HTML5/CSS3/JQuery. Given more time and resources, I probably would have opted for something better than a static website (currently, the web administrator has to copy HTML code for new members of the group and new articles, which is not ideal). However, given the parameter and scope for the project (the client was more concerned with how it looked and few changes had to be made to it over an extended period of time).
</p>
<p>I learned a lot from this project in terms of neat CSS tricks and other cool things. There's a subscription box at the top that submits to a Google from! Positioning the articles in the mocked up iPhone was also a bit tricky. I admittedly messed up on the "MIG in the Press" section; the hover effects function but are clunky given that it's done using javascript and doesn't track when mouseexits so it's possible to invert and re-invert the color of the news icons by dragging the mouse in and out repeatedly. There's a more elegant solution out there (possibly with -webkit-filter).

<h3>The Short</h3>

<p>ASES is the Asia-Pacific Student Entrepreneurship Society at Stanford University.</p>

<h3>Role</h3>
<p>
In 2013, I lead the ASES Summit team, organizing a 1-week entrepreneurship conference that drew hundreds of applicants from around the world. In the end, we had a 40-member group of young entrepreneurs from over 10 different countries. We have had speakers like Adam D'Angelo, Phil Libin, and Guy Kawasaki. Learn more about ASES Summit here.
</p>
<p>
In 2014, I served as President of ASES, leading a reformation of the group, growing it from a team of 10 people to one of the most popular student organizations on campus. Learn more about ASES and its Frosh/Soph ASES Bootcamp program here.
</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>
Early on, I handled creating many of our static landing pages, many of which have since been updated by our Marketing team.
</p>
<p>
Now, I am working on creating an application review system for the group. Just for some context, we have to do comprehensive application reviews several times throughout the year (for selective programs like ASES Summit); we have traditionally used a system of Google Spreadsheets to handle this process, but it has become cumbersome to scale over time as our programs have gotten larger. 
</p>
<p>
The system is still being built, but currently has the following functionality:
	<ul class="classicList">
		<li>Allow potential applicants to save and review responses</li>
		<li>Allow interviewers to comment and rate the written portion of the application</li>
		<li>Mail-merge app to notify applicants and move them to different 'stages'</li>
		<li>Allow applicants to sign up for in-person interview times</li>
		<li>Dashboard to allow reviewers to sort and manage applications</li>
	</ul>

					<h3>The Short</h3>
					<p>
					Soundboard is a Swift app that allows users to create soundboards full of short audio clips of their friends.
					</p>
					<h3>Details</h3>
					<p>
					This is the first extensive project that I've done in Swift. I created it as my final project for CS193P, which is a Swift class at Stanford University.

					<h3>The Short</h3>
					<p>
					StartX is an accelerator in the Palo Alto area. I worked as a part of their tech team in a full-stack capacity in the Summer of 2015. Learn more about them here.
					</p>
					<h3>Projects:</h3>
					<p>
					I was responsible for making fixes to StartX founder applicant system that it uses for its accelerator program. The problem here was that although the accelerator application was being handled online, the review process was still largely analog. I designed platforms this summer to aid the review and decision process.
					</p>
					<p>
					Here are a few things I did during this summer:
					<ul class="classicList">
						<li>Created Interview tables to allow for room coordination for administrative staff and accelerator applicants</li>
						<li>Generate data dumps (CSV spreadsheets) that were previously manually created on a regular basis</li>
						<li>Made several UI changes to the front-end of the accelerator application to enhance clarity</li>
						<li>Designed case-file views for each startup applicant to aid review process</li>
						<li>Was a generally cheery and amiable co-worker</li>

					<h3>The Short</h3>
					<p>
					We created a partner-based exercise app prototype based on our observation of mentor-mentee relationships in Alcoholic Anonymous groups and mentorship pairings in corporate environments. 
					</p>
					<h3>Needfinding</h3>
					<p>
					We were interested in how professional mentorships and emotional support systems worked, so we sat in a local Alcoholic Anonymous meeting and talked to a Senior Engineer at LinkedIn about how the dynamics with peer-based support systems. The questions we asked are available above, but we learned valuable things about mentors were found and what made certain mentor-mentee relationships good. 
					</p>
					<p>
					We decided to apply what we learned to create a platform to assist friends in sticking with a workout regimen. We were aware that apps like Nike+ allowed friends to cheer each other run during workouts, but we had an intuition from our needfinding that 1-to-1 relationships would be more fruitful.
					</p>
					<h3>Prototype</h3>
					<p>
					We built a quick, lean static prototype that allowed one user to log activity and see simulated responses from their partner. My role in this was mainly designing and creating the dragging mechanism on the bar (which you can see on the live site).
					</p>
					<h3>User Testing</h3>
					<p>
					We tested our static prototype with a group of college freshmen and got mixed results. We got great feedback on the visual elements we used: we found out which visual indicators we used were clear and which ones weren't. We also learned that users didn't mind "bothering" the other person with messages because, ultimately, they knew it was for a good cause.
